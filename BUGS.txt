000 ShapeScale nodekit causes continuous redraws.

    When using this nodekit in the SoGuiExamples/nodekits/scalemarker
    example, it sometimes doesn't stop sending notifications to the
    scenegraph -- causing it to continually trigger redraws.

    This is quite straightforward to reproduce, just try starting and
    stopping spin animations while having set the envvar
    COIN_SHOW_FPS_COUNTER=1, and you'll sooner or later see that it
    won't stop redrawing even though the scene camera's position and
    orientation is frozen.

001 SoText2Set miscalculates bounding boxes.

    This might just be a missing feature (I didn't check), but it is
    the case that SoGetBoundingBoxAction does not return the actual
    bounding box for an SoText2Set node -- only the bounding box
    surrounding the point positions for the text strings (i.e. and
    does not take into account the string bbox themselves).

    UPDATE: Parts of this bug should have been fixed now. See bug #002
    for info about the remaining issues.

002 SoText2Set creates too small bounding boxes for rotated strings

    The bounding box will not come out right when a string has a
    justification != RIGHT and an extreme rotation (about 90+
    degrees). Some parts of the string will then be outside the
    bounding box, leading to incorrect culling.

003 ViewportRegion node fails with tiled SoOffscreenRendering.

    See detailed description of bug as item #121 in Coin/BUGS.txt.

004 SoText2Set should be migrated to the new Coin cc_glyph2d interface.

    It is now using the obsoleted SoGlyph class in Coin, which will
    probably be removed before releasing Coin 3.0.

    Note that the cc_glyph* and cc_fontspec* interfaces have not been
    made public in Coin. They need a final audit before letting them
    fly.

005 SmScenery node causes continuous redraws.

    When using this node in any scene graph, it will for some reason
    cause continuous notifications from the scenegraph -- causing it
    to continually trigger redraws.

    This is quite straightforward to reproduce, just set the envvar
    COIN_SHOW_FPS_COUNTER=1 and load an SmScenery node, and you'll see
    that it won't stop redrawing even though the scene's camera is
    kept static.

    I just added some convenient debugging stuff to Coin to aid in
    these situations: by setting the envvar
    COIN_DEBUG_ROOT_NOTIFICATIONS=1, the SoSceneManager will dump the
    full notification chain of any changes made to the scene
    graph. For some strange reason, this didn't help much with this
    bug, as the notification chain seems rather non-sensical for
    whatever happens with the SmScenery node. Could be a bug with the
    Coin notification tracking mechanism -- should investigate.

006 Use of SmScenery node causes glGetError() to report
    GL_INVALID_ENUM.

    ..but only for some drivers (like oso's laptop). Need to find out
    why, it seems to have grave consequences on some drivers, like
    completely short-cutting the visualization of Scenery data.
