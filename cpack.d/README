This directory is aimed to decouple project building from packaging since 
maintainer rules are generally independent from the developer ones and strongly
OS specific.

So the idea is to provide this space for hosting OS targeted CPack  template 
files, ready to be instantiated by a CMake configure_file() call.

The CMakeLists.txt will automatically configure every template postfixed with
'*.cmake.in' .

The configured CPack configuration will be ready in the CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR.
The package will be produced by the following command:

cpack --config </path/to/the/produced/config>
